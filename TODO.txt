1) Prepare a script that queries the user during the setup and sets the 
grafana admin user name and initial password (seeding grafana/.env, or 
overriding it).

2) the script should also get names and roles for access to node-red and
influxdb. It then will seed .hgaccess and .htgroup. 

3) same script should be able to show user-by-user roles, and adjust them.

4) Add the auto-update cron script 

5) See if there's a way to make the docker-compose print a message and stop 
if the configuration operation hasn't been done.

6) update the README.md

7) integrate the other things from SETUP.txt

8) Change to use phusion as the base: use phusion/baseimage rather than 
ubuntu/ubuntu, and then add the proper tweaks. See https://github.com/phusion/baseimage-docker
